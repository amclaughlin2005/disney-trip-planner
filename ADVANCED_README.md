## üõ£Ô∏è Routing System

### **React Router Integration**
- **Main App Route** (`/`): Trip planning interface
- **Admin Panel Route** (`/admin`): Super admin dashboard
- **Protected Routes**: Role-based access control
- **Navigation**: Seamless switching between interfaces

### **Route Protection**
```typescript
// AdminRoute component ensures only super admins can access /admin
const AdminRoute = ({ children }) => {
  const { appUser, loading } = useUserManagement();
  
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (!appUser?.isSuperAdmin) return <Navigate to="/" />;
  
  return children;
};
```
