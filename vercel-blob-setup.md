# 🗄️ Vercel Blob Storage Setup Guide

## Overview

Vercel Blob provides simple, fast, and secure file storage for your applications. It's perfect for storing your Disney trip data in the cloud with automatic global distribution.

## Getting Your Vercel Blob Token

### Step 1: Access Your Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Log in to your Vercel account
3. Select your Disney Trip Planner project

### Step 2: Navigate to Storage
1. In your project dashboard, click on the **"Storage"** tab
2. Click **"Create Database"** or **"Browse All"**
3. Select **"Blob"** from the storage options
4. Click **"Create"** to set up Blob storage for your project

### Step 3: Get Your API Token
1. Once Blob storage is created, go to **Settings** > **Environment Variables**
2. Vercel automatically creates the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` for you
3. Copy the token value (it starts with `vercel_blob_rw_`)

## Environment Variable Setup

### ⚠️ Important: Local Development Limitation
**Vercel Blob storage only works in production due to CORS restrictions.** In local development, the app will automatically use local storage instead.

### For Local Development:
1. Create/update your `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   REACT_APP_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_your-token-here
   ```
2. Restart your development server (`npm start`)
3. **Note**: The app will use local storage in development and show "Local storage (Cloud storage available in production)"

### For Production (Vercel):
The environment variable is automatically configured when you create Blob storage. Vercel Blob will work seamlessly in production!

## 🚀 Benefits of Vercel Blob

### ✅ **Advantages over Firebase:**
- **Simpler Setup**: No complex configuration
- **Integrated**: Built into your Vercel deployment
- **Automatic**: Environment variables set up automatically
- **Fast**: Global CDN for quick access

4. **Backup**: Built-in redundancy and reliability

## 📁 Data Organization

Your trips are organized like this:
```
trips/
├── device-123456789/
│   ├── trip-1.json
│   ├── trip-2.json
│   └── trip-3.json
└── device-987654321/
    ├── trip-1.json
    └── trip-2.json
```

Each device gets its own folder, keeping your trips private and organized.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**CORS errors in local development**
- This is expected! Vercel Blob only works in production
- Your app will automatically fall back to local storage in development
- Deploy to Vercel to test cloud storage functionality

**"Vercel Blob not configured"**
- Check that your environment variable is set correctly
- Ensure the token starts with `vercel_blob_rw_`
- Restart your development server after adding the token
- Remember: Only works in production, not local development

**"Failed to save trip to cloud storage"**
- Verify your Vercel project has Blob storage enabled
- Check that you haven't exceeded your storage quota
- Ensure your token has read/write permissions

**Token not working in production**
- Blob storage environment variables are set automatically in production
- If issues persist, recreate the Blob storage in your Vercel dashboard
- Check the Vercel deployment logs for detailed error messages

### Getting Help:
- Check the [Vercel Blob documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob)
- Monitor your usage in the Vercel dashboard
- Contact Vercel support for storage-related issues

## 🔄 Migration from Firebase

If you were previously using Firebase:

1. **Your existing trips** will remain in local storage
2. **New trips** will automatically save to Vercel Blob
3. **Export/Import** your existing trips to move them to Blob storage
4. **Remove Firebase** configuration (already done in this update)

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Built-in Security:
- **Device-based isolation**: Each device has its own folder
- **Access tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **HTTPS only**: All data transferred securely
- **Automatic cleanup**: Unused blobs are automatically managed

### Privacy:
- **No user accounts required**: Uses device-based identification
- **Private by default**: Only your device can access your trips
- **No tracking**: Simple file storage without analytics

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Enable Blob storage** in your Vercel project dashboard
2. **Copy the token** to your local environment
3. **Test the connection** by creating a new trip
4. **Monitor usage** in your Vercel dashboard
